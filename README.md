##Assignment 1: Full Stack Using Chatgpt
####Name: Calculator Full Stack App
Description: Used ChatGPT to help me make a full stack calculator app that uses javascript/html/css
for the front end, postgresql for the database, node, Json for transport and node for the backend. 
Used docker to run everything. I have a folder with photos of my conversation with chatgpt. The full 
conversation is much longer, since I had to keep asking it to help me debug, but I did include the 
main prompt and some other questions I asked it.
